    "The word comedy is said 229 times in Africa Science magazine than in the Society for Science magazine. l'khbr is said about 149 times in Africa Science magazine than in the Society for Science magazine. ltknwlwjy is said about 125 times in Africa Science magazine than in the Society for Science magazine. Journalists is said about 104 times in Africa Science magazine than in the Society for Science magazine. The next five words are probably in African languages, which make sense if they are said that many times in Africa Science magazine than the USA magazine. It is interesting to see that local languages are used with the English language, but it is natural to do so, assuming that that all readers understand it. Now, I want/am interested to also pull up the sentences where those words are used to see if I could guess/understand them in context. "

    "Lexical Dispersion is one thing to automatically detect that a particular word occurs in a text, and to display some words that appear in the same context. However, we can also determine the location of a word in the text: how many words from the beginning it appears. [link](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html). The lexical dispersion below shows the frequency of word types from the AfriScience magazine and the next one the frequency of words from the Society for Science & the Republic magazine. "

    "## Observations\n",
    "The characters are different when the words are non-English words. For example, the word \"Journalists\" is in sentences that are more formal and informative about different news channels in Africa and in the Emirates. However, the other top words \"Comedy\", \"ltknwlwjy\", \"Sains\" are in sentence that have unusual characters, misspelled words, and repetitve sentences. For example, technolgy is spelled as Teknologi and go along with the words Sains. For these reasons, some of the sentences are suspuscious, leading the steps below to know more about the followers of AfriScience magazine. The objective is to find which followers are real users and which ones are bots. "

    "## What I was hoping to do but did not get to:\n",
    "Hi John, I spent sooooooo many hours and tried few models to detect the list of bots. I also tried the method above and followed their instructions but no luck. So, I used a different method, which I explained in the write up! I have chuncks of unsuccessful codes in here, folowing this chuck, that I deleted. I can you send a draft, that I saved, if need be. I also thought of doing sentiment analysis based on this [article](https://dev.to/rodolfoferro/sentiment-analysis-on-trumpss-tweets-using-python-so) that I could classify accounts with popularities and likes as a way to detect the bots but I don't have all the info that I need in my files. I am basically proofreading my codes in the last minutes because of trying to accomplish this... \n",

    "I apologize for both my write up, I did not get to have them proofread. Sometimes I repeat myself or I have sentence structures differently, maybe still thinking in French when writing. Hopefully the ideas flow smoothly.\n",
